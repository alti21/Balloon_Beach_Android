# Balloon_Beach_Android
An Android game I made using Unity Engine and C#. The goal of the game is to get the highest score while avoiding the rocks.
The ball goes faster and faster as time goes on, so the game becomes more challenging. The level is infinitely long, so the game ends
when the ball hits a rock.
I used Unity and C# to develop this game during a Udemy course.

in the directory Assets/scripts/ folder, you can view the different scripts that I wrote for the game: 
!) App initialization 
@) Player: the ball that you control
3) Camera
4) Level generator: for generating the infinitely long level
5) Object spawner: for spawning the rocks
6) Score
