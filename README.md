# Balloon_Beach_Android
An Android game I made using Unity Engine and C#. The goal of the game is to get the highest score while avoiding the rocks.
The ball goes faster and faster as time goes on, so the game becomes more challenging.
I used Unity and C# to develop this game during a Udemy course.
